# MongoDB-Management-App
A program that provides a graphical user interface for managing a MongoDB database with role-based access control, allowing users to log in as read-only, read/write, or admin users to perform CRUD operations on two collections: users and coupons. The application validates user credentials through MongoDB authentication, displays dynamic input fields based on the selected collection, and enforces data validation, including email format checking and date formatting. Users can create new records, read all documents, update existing entries by specifying filter criteria, and delete documents through an intuitive Tkinter-based interface with error handling for permission failures and constraint violations.
